###   Troubleshooting
_________________________________

   - If you were previously using a repack, please uninstall it first.
     
   - If you cannot properly remove the older WinRAR from everywhere (including registry), try using Revo Uninstaller Pro to scan and delete file and registry remnants.

   - Make sure the latest original WinRAR setup is used for the installation.
     
   - Download WinRAR: [https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm)

   - Now install WinRAR and wait for the script to finish.
   
   - If you're facing any problems, just make an issue and report.
